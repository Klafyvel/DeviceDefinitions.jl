# SVD2Julia

A code generator for creating Julia projects from SVD files.

This package is based on https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/SVD/html/index.html, but not a complete
implementation of the specification. If you get an error or warning while using this package,
please open an issue (with the SVD in question included, if possible).

Known not working:

 * Deriving registers/fields from registers/fields that are not direct siblings.
  * This is mostly because I don't have an example SVD making extensive use of that feature.

Additionally, it's possible that some definitions generated by this package could have a bug; make sure to check the generated
code for compliance with your SVD. Please do report any bugs discovered through this in an issue.

## API

The main API of this package are `generateProject` and `readSVD`. Please check their respective docstrings for usage.
In addition to these, the structs `Device`, `Peripheral`, `Register`, `Field` and `CPU` are also considered API. Their fieldnames
are inspired by the names from the SVD specification.

## Licensing of generated packages
