# DeviceDefinitions

A code generator for creating Julia projects from SVD files.

This package is based on https://www.keil.com/pack/doc/CMSIS/SVD/html/index.html, but not a complete
implementation of the specification. If you get an error or warning while using this package,
please open an issue (with the SVD in question included, if possible).

Known not working:

 * Deriving registers/fields from registers/fields that are not direct siblings.
  * This is mostly because I don't have an example SVD making use of that feature.

Additionally, it's possible that some definitions generated by this package could have a bug; make sure to check the generated
code for compliance with your SVD. Please do report any bugs discovered through this in an issue.

## API

The main API of this package are `generate` and `readSVD`. Please check their respective docstrings for usage.
In addition to these, the structs `Device`, `Peripheral`, `Register`, `Field` and `CPU` are also considered API. Their fieldnames
are inspired by the names from the SVD specification.

## Layout of generated packages

Packages generated by DeviceDefinitions.jl follow this structure (peripheral names exemplary):

```
Name.jl
├── Manifest.toml
├── Project.toml
└── src
    ├── peripherals
    │   ├── adc.jl
    │   ├── dma.jl
    │   ├── ...
    │   └── watchdog.jl
    ├── peripherals.jl
    ├── Name.jl
    └── SVD
        └── name.svd
```

The source SVD file is placed under `src/SVD` with its original name. When regenerating, only `src/Name.jl`, `src/peripherals.jl` and the `src/peripherals` directory
will be deleted & regenerated. It is safe to add other directories to the project.

A single peripheral is stored in its own submodule, with each register of that peripheral also stored in its own subsubmodule. For example:

```julia
"""
    ADC

Control and data interface to ADC
"""
module ADC

const baseAddress = Ptr{UInt16}(3141592)

"""
    CS

ADC Control and Status
"""
module CSMod

using MCUCommon: @regdef, Read, Write, ReadWrite, ReadWriteOnce
using ..ADC: baseAddress

const regAddress = baseAddress + 0x0000000000000000
@regdef struct CSStruct(regAddress)
	FieldA:1::ReadWrite
	_:4
	FieldB:5::Read
	_:6
end
const Reg = CSStruct

"""
    FieldA

Description of Field A
"""
FieldA

# ... other fields of this register ...

end # register CS

# ... other registers ...

end # peripheral
```

To access the data of e.g. the `CS` register in peripheral `ADC`, use `ADC.CSMod.Reg[]`, which will return a bitfield describing the register.
To read a single field of that register, use `ADC.CSMod.FieldA[]`. Likewise, setting the register/field works through `setindex!` without indexing arguments.

Packages generated with DeviceDefinitions.jl are NOT licensed under the same license as DeviceDefinitions.jl and may be restricted through the license
specified in the SVD used to generate the package.
